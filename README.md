# Markov Chain - Generic Programming Project

**Introduction**
This C-based generic Markov chain project is my solution for the 3rd exercise in the "C/C++ course" at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It utilizes generic programming principles. The program employs a Markov chain to generate random sequences of words based on an input text corpus.

**Tweets Generator**
The primary focus is on the tweets_generator aspect of the project. The program takes an input text corpus and utilizes a Markov chain to generate random sequences of words. Each sequence serves as a representation of a tweet or other data structures, highlighting the versatility of the implementation.

## Files

1. **tweets_generator.c**
   - Implements the Markov chain to generate tweets.

2. **linked_list.h / linked_list.c**
   - Header and source files for a basic linked list implementation.
   - Used for managing the Markov chain database.

3. **markov_chain.h / markov_chain.c**
   - Header and source files defining the Markov chain data structure and related functions.
   - Handles the generation of random sequences based on the Markov chain.

4. **CMakeLists.txt**
   - The CMake configuration file to build the executable.

5. **makefile**
   - Makefile for convenient project compilation and execution.

6. **snakes_and_ladders.c**
   - Test file showcasing the generic implementation of the Markov chain with a different data type.

## Compilation and Execution

### Tweets Generator

To compile and execute the tweets generator, use the following commands in the terminal (make sure you are in the directory containing the source code files):

```bash
make tweets
./tweets_generator 123 2 "justdoit_tweets.txt" [words_to_read]
```

The `make tweets` command will generate a compiled file that can be run with the provided example command-line arguments (e.g., `123 2 "justdoit_tweets.txt"`).

### Snakes and Ladders

To compile and execute the snakes and ladders, use the following commands (make sure you are in the directory containing the source code files):

```bash
make snake
./ladders_and_snakes 2 3
```

- `<seed>`: Seed for the random number generator.
- `<num_tweets>`: Number of tweets to generate.
- `<text_corpus_file>`: Path to the text corpus file.
- `[words_to_read]` (optional): Number of words to read from the text corpus.

## Error Messages

- `ARG_ERR_MSG`: Indicates an invalid number of command-line arguments.
- `FILE_ERR_MSG`: Indicates an issue with the specified text corpus file.
- `ALLOCATION_ERR_MSG`: Indicates a memory allocation failure.

## Functionality

### Tweets Generator
The tweets generator program offers the following functionalities:

1. **Text Corpus Processing:**
   - Reads the specified text corpus file to extract information.
   - Builds a Markov chain database based on the processed data.

2. **Tweet Generation:**
   - Utilizes the Markov chain database to generate random sequences of words.
   - Constructs coherent and contextually relevant tweet-like sequences.

3. **Output:**
   - Displays the generated tweets on the console.

### Snakes and Ladders Game
The snakes and ladders program provides the following functionalities:

1. **Game Setup:**
   - Configures the game board with snakes and ladders.
   - Defines game rules and outcomes for encounters with snakes and ladders.

2. **Player Movement:**
   - Simulates player movement on the board based on dice rolls.
   - Handles interactions with snakes and ladders, updating player positions.

3. **Game State Tracking:**
   - Tracks the current game state, including player positions and special events.

4. **Console Display:**
   - Shows the progress of the game, including player positions and special events.
